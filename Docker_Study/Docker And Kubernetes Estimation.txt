- Difference between VM and Containers(Both pros and cons) (15 mins)
- Docker Engine Architecture (30 mins)
- What are Docker Images? (30 minutes)
- How does Docker internally create a container? (1 hour)
- Relation between Docker images and Docker Containers (Should get covered in above point only)
- Awareness of Docker products other than Docker Engine [Registry, Compose, Machine, Swarm] (1 hour)
- How to build custom Docker images? (1 hour)
- Familiarity with Docker CLI & REST API: Basic commands like: ps, run, build, exec, rm, rmi, restart, stop, pull, history, create etc. Basic operations to try out. (3 hours)

- How to check if container is still healthy?  (15 mins)

- How do containers store data? (30 mins)
- Docker Networking basics (3 hours)

- Very basic familiarity with Docker Compose, Machine and Swarm(purpose, and basic terminologies) (30 mins)
- How does image-layer caching work? (1 hour)
- How does Docker(not container) store data? [For infrastructure inspection purpose][Optional] (1 hours)
- Different options for storage [basic driver names and brief configuration with respect to Docker] (30 mins)
- Different options for networking [basic driver names and brief configuration with respect to Docker] (1 hour)

Kubernetes Basic Induction
- What is Kubernetes? (30 mins)
- Basic Understanding of Kubernetes Architecture
	a. Nodes(2 hours):
		Master Node: Components and Responsibilities
		Worker Node: Components and Responsibilities
		How does communication take place between nodes
	b.	Pod (30 mins)
	c.	Deployment (30 mins)
	d.	Replica Set(30 mins)
	e.	Daemon Sets(30 mins)
	f.	Services(2 hours)
	g.	Storage: Volumes and its types (2 hours)
	h.	Autoscaling (1 hour)
	i.	How to go inside a container in Kubernetes? (Similar to docker exec -it) (30 mins)
	For Autoscaling, first monitoring(using heapster) needs to be understood

- Log and Monitoring (2 hours)
- Explore authentication mechanisms, user management strategies supported by Kubernetes with focus on RBAC (3 hours)
- Installation, REST API & Tryouts of all concepts/components(including RBAC): 7 hours

Estimated: 22 hours
